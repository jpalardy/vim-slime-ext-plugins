Grab some text and "send" it to a REPL session.

                         VIM --> vim-slime --> REPL~

Presumably, your session contains a REPL, maybe Clojure, R or python. If you
can type text into it, vim-slime can send text to it.

The reason you're doing this? Because you want the benefits of a REPL and the
benefits of using Vim (familiar environment, syntax highlighting, persistence
...).

1. Slime Usage                                                   *slime-usage*

                                                  *CTRL-C_CTRL-C* *<c-c><c-c>*
<c-c><c-c>          Send the current paragraph text to REPL. Slime will prompt
                    for configuration if slime is not configured for the
                    current buffer.

                                              *v_CTRL-C_CTRL-C* *v_<c-c><c-c>*
{Visual}<c-c><c-c>  Send highlighted text to REPL.

                                                           *CTRL-C_v* *<c-c>v*
                                                                *:SlimeConfig*
<c-c>v              Setup slime. You will be prompted for information
:SlimeConfig        regarding plugin configuration if needed.

                                                                  *:SlimeSend*
:<range>SlimeSend   Send a [range] of lines to REPL. If no range is provided
                    the current line is sent.

See |slime-configuration| for advanced commands and mappings.

==============================================================================
2. Plugin Configuration                           *slime-plugin-configuration*

Vim-slime needs a plugin to actually send your code to the REPL. Several
plugins are available, see |slime-plugins|. 

A plugin should expose at least one target function that will be used by
vim-slime to send data to the REPL. The signature must be :

`MyTargetFunction(config, text)`

With `config` being the configuration variable and `text` the text which is to
be sent. Vim-slime takes care to initialize the configuration by calling the
defined configuration function. Such a function must have the following
signature :

`MyConfigFunction(config)`

And return the modified configuration.

Both target and configuration functions must be declared to vim-slime using
|b:slime_target_send| or |g:slime_target_send| and |b:slime_target_config| and
|g:slime_target_config| respectively. The buffer variable takes precedence
over the global variable, so you can use different plugins for different
buffers. 

Note: If your plugin does not need any configuration, you can register
`slime#noop` instead of your configuration function.


==============================================================================
3. Available Plugins                                           *slime-plugins*

You can find a list of available target plugins at
https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime-ext-plugins 

==============================================================================
4. Slime Configuration                                   *slime-configuration*

Global Variables~

*g:slime_target_send*       |string| used to register the plugin's target 
                          function
*g:slime_target_config*     |string| used to register the plugin's configuration
                          function
*g:slime_no_mappings*     If set, disable the default mappings.

Buffer Variables~

*b:slime_target_send*       Same as |g:slime_target_send|, but takes precedence
                          over it.
*b:slime_target_config*     Same as |g:slime_target_config| but takes
                          precedence over it.

Mappings~

Note: The default mappings can be disabled using |g:slime_no_mappings|.

*<Plug>SlimeRegionSend*       Send text in visual or select mode. Default
                            mapping is <c-c><c-c> in normal and select mode.
*<Plug>SlimeParagraphSend*    Send the current paragraph. Default mapping is
                            <c-c><c-c> in normal mode.
*<Plug>SlimeConfig*           Trigger plugin configuration. Default mapping is
                            <c-c>v in normal mode.
*<Plug>SlimeMotionSend*       The slime operator allows user to send the
                            current selection. Seel |slime-operator-example|.
*<Plug>SlimeLineSend*         Send the current line to REPL.

Commands~

*:SlimeConfig*                Trigger plugin configuration.
*:SlimeSend*                  Send the lines given in parameters.
                            `:3,7SlimeSend` will send lines 3 to 7 to REPL.
                            You can also use |marks|.
*:SlimeSend1*                 Send the given parameter string to REPL.
                            `:SlimeSend1 print("Hello World")` will send 
                            `print("Hello World")` followed by a newline
                            character ("\r") to REPL.
*:SlimeSend0*                 Same as |:SlimeSend1|, without newline character.
*:SlimeSendCurrentLine*       Send current line to REPL.

                                                      *slime-operator-example*
SlimeMotionSend example~

Vim-slime defines its own |operator| that allows you to use all kind of
motions (see |motion.txt|) to send your data.

For example |<Plug>SlimeParagraphSend| is defined as |<Plug>SlimeMotionSendip|,
which calls |<Plug>SlimeMotionSend| on the current "inner paragraph" (see |ip|).

By default |<Plug>SlimeMotionSend| is not mapped. Users can create their own
mapping in their configuration file, e.g. :

`noremap cs <Plug>SlimeMotionSend`

With the above mapping it becomes possible for users to finely tune what they
send. Thus, in the following configuration >

  This is "some fairly nice" text
                ⮤ Cursor is here
>
Pressing `csi"` will send `some fairly nice` to the REPL.

5. Slime functions                                           *slime-functions*

Vim-slime defines a public interface that you can use.

slime#send({text})                                              *slime#send()*
          Send the given {text} to the target.

slime#config()                                                *slime#config()*
          Trigger vim-slime configuration and return the configuration. If 
          vim-slime is already configured for the current buffer, return the
          current configuration.

slime#reconfig()                                            *slime#reconfig()*
          Force vim-slime reconfiguration. Erase current buffer configuration
          and call |slime#config()|.

slime#noop(...)                                                 *slime#noop()*
          Do nothing. Useful to feed to |g:slime_target_config| when a plugin
          does not need any configuration.

slime#send_op({type}, ...)                                   *slime#send_op()*
          The operator function used by |<Plug>SlimeMotionSend|. It is intended
          to be used either manually or through |g@|. To use it manually, you
          should set |a:0| to something (the actual value does not matter).
          When used manually, |slime#send_op()| selects what is between the 
          |`<| and |`>| tags (last selected Visual area in current buffer)
          with the given {type} mode. You could for example use the last
          visual mode, given by |visualmode()|.

slime#send_range({startline}, {endline})                  *slime#send_range()*
          Send the lines from {startline} to {endline}.
